## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
### Definition: 
In Breadth-First Search (BFS), we search the graph from the root node in order of the distance from the root. 

### Explanation: 
* Because the order search is nearest the root, BFS is guaranteed to find the best possible solution (shallowest) in a non-weighted graph, and is therefore also complete. 
* Rather than digging deep down into the graph, progressing further and further from the root (as is the case with DFS), BFS checks each node nearest the root before descending to the next level.
* The implementation of BFS uses a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue, differing from the stack (LIFO) implementation for DFS.
* As new nodes are found to be searched, these nodes are checked against the goal, and if the goal is not found, the new nodes are added to the queue. To continue the search, the oldest node is dequeued (FIFO order). Using FIFO order for new node search, we always check the oldest nodes first, resulting in breadth-first review

* The disadvantage of BFS is that each node that is searched is required to be stored (space complexity is O(bd)). 
* The entire depth of the tree does not have to be searched, so d in this context is the depth of the solution, not the maximum depth of the tree. 
* Time complexity is also O(bd).

Note: In practical implementations of BFS, and other search algorithms, a closed list is maintained that contains those nodes in the graph that have been visited. 
This allows the algorithm to efficiently search the graph without re-visiting nodes. In implementations where the graph is weighted, keeping a closed list is not possible.
