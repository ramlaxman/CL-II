### General Search Paradigms
Before we discuss some of the uninformed search methods, let’s look at two simple general uninformed search methods.

which are truly blind methods of search. They can get lost, get caught in loops, and potentially never find a 

solution even though one exists within the search space.

#### 1. ‘Generate and Test.’: 
In this method, we generate a potential solution and then check it against the solution. If we’ve found the solution, we’re done, otherwise, we repeat by trying another potential solution. This is called ‘Generate and Test’ because we generate a potential solution, and then test it. Without a proper solution, we try again. Note here that we don’t keep track of what we’ve tried before; we just plow ahead with potential solutions, which is a true blind search.

#### 2. ‘Random Search’: 
It randomly selects a new state from the current state (by selecting a given valid operator and applying it). If we reach the goal state, then we’re done. Otherwise, we randomly select another operator (leading to a new state) and continue.

Here are some search methods that while blind, can find a solution (if one exists) even if it takes a long period of time.
