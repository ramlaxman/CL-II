In this document, we will see two variations of DFS:
- DLS 
- IDS

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Definition: 
  The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is a technique for searching a graph that begins at the root node, and exhaustively searches each branch to its greatest depth before backtracking to previously unexplored branches. 

### Explanation: 
  Nodes found but yet to be reviewed are stored in a LIFO queue (also known as a stack). If cycles are not present in the graph, then the algorithm is complete (will always find the goal node). The DFS algorithm is also not optimal, but can be made optimal using path checking (to ensure the shortest path to the goal is found).

### Complexity: 
  The space complexity for DFS is O (b*d) where the time complexity is geometric (O (b^d)). 

### Issues:
* This can be very problematic on deep branching graphs, as the algorithm will continue to the maximum depth of the graph. 
* If loops are present in the graph, then DFS will follow these cycles indefinitely. For this reason, the DFS algorithm is not complete, as cycles can prohibit the algorithm from finding the goal.
  

## Depth-Limited Search (DLS)

### Definition:
  Depth-Limited Search (DLS) is a modification of depth-first search that minimizes the depth that the search algorithm may go. 

### Explain: 
* In addition to starting with a root and goal node, a depth is provided that the algorithm will not descend below. 
* Any nodes below that depth are omitted from the search. This modification keeps the algorithm from indefinitely cycling by halting the search after the pre-imposed depth. 
* Figure 2.12 illustrates this search with a depth of two (no nodes deeper than level two are searched).
* While the algorithm does remove the possibility of infinitely looping in the graph, it also reduces the scope of the search. 
* If the goal node had been one of the nodes marked ‘X’, it would not have been found, making the search algorithm incomplete.
* The algorithm can be complete if the search depth is that of the tree itself (in this case d is three). The technique is also not optimal since the first path may be found to the goal instead of the shortest path.

### Complexity:
The time and space complexity of depth-limited search is similar to DFS, from which this algorithm is derived.
Space complexity is O (b*d) and time complexity is O (bd), but d in this case is the imposed depth of the search and not the maximum depth of the graph.

## Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

### Definition: 
Derivative of DLS and combines the features of depth-first search with that of breadth-first search. IDS operates by performing DLS searches with increased depths until the goal is found. 

### Explain:
* The depth begins at one, and increases until the goal is found, or no further nodes can be enumerated.
* As shown in Figure, IDS combines depth-first search with breadth first search.
* By minimizing the depth of the search, we force the algorithm to also search the breadth of the graph. If the goal is not found, the depth that the algorithm is permitted to search is increased and the algorithm is started again.
* IDS is advantageous because it’s not susceptible to cycles (a characteristic of DLS, upon which it’s based). It also finds the goal nearest to the root node, as does the BFS algorithm (which will be detailed next). 
* For this reason, it’s a preferred algorithm when the depth of the solution is not known. Unlike  DFS  and  DLS,  IDS  is  will  always  find  the  best  solution and therefore, it is both complete and optimal.

### Complexity: 
The time complexity for IDS is identical to that of DFS and DLS, O (b^d). Space complexity of IDS is O(b*d).
