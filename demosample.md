## Search in a Puzzle Space

The “Towers of Hanoi” puzzle is an interesting example of a state space for solving a puzzle problem.
Each disk is of a unique size and it’s not legal for a larger disk to sit on top of a smaller disk. 
The initial state of the puzzle is such that all disks begin on one peg in increasing size order (see Figure 2.2). 
Our goal (the solution) is to move all disks to the last peg.
